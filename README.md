# Gpt-Agreement-Payment

End-to-end replay tool for ChatGPT Plus / Team subscription agreements: reverse-engineered from packet capture the entire chain `Stripe Checkout → PayPal / GoPay / QRIS → ChatGPT manual-approval → Codex OAuth + PKCE` and implemented as a runnable client. Includes a from-scratch hCaptcha visual solver, PayPal fraud detection early-exit branch, and a set of empirical anti-fraud mechanism data collected from real execution.

## What This Is

Supports four subscription activation paths:

| Path | Entry Point | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **Team / Plus (PayPal billing agreement)** | `pipeline.py --paypal` | Stripe Checkout → PayPal billing agreement → ChatGPT manual approval |
| **Plus (promo long link + PayPal agreement auth)** | `scripts/no_card_paypal_plus.py` | OpenAI official promo campaign long link + PayPal guest checkout completing billing agreement protocol |
| **Plus / Team (GoPay Indonesia)** | `pipeline.py --gopay` | Midtrans linking + GoPay wallet binding, IDR region exclusive |
| **Plus / Team (QRIS scan)** | `pipeline.py --qris` | Midtrans QRIS, remote preview + reference polling settlement |

Given a clean proxy + payment credential, run the command to completion and get the OAuth `refresh_token`.

Four points worth examining:

- **N-worker concurrency + phone-lock OTP critical section mutual exclusion** (`webui/backend/parallel_runner.py`). Same phone across multiple workers serializes OTP phase using advisory lock, pre/post-OTP fully parallelized; DB atomic claim + placeholder INSERT prevents multiple workers contending for same promo_link / same inventory email. Frontend configures phone pool (M rows) + concurrency N (can exceed M), worker maps to phone pool via `i % M` round-robin.
- **hCaptcha visual solver** (`CTF-pay/hcaptcha_auto_solver.py`, ~4000 lines, independently usable). VLM primary path + CLIP/OpenCV heuristic fallback + Playwright human action synthesis, covers 12 known hCaptcha question types.
- **Anti-fraud mechanism empirical data**. IP string-level exact fingerprinting, batch correlation delayed banning, probe layer vs ban layer separation. Measured sample of ~2% 24-hour survival rate across 45 accounts, including corrected models. See [`docs/anti-fraud-research.md`](docs/anti-fraud-research.md).
- **Twelve-path self-healing daemon loops** (`pipeline.py::daemon()`). Webshare API auto IP rotation (webshare jitter fallback to `/tmp/gost_last.json` cache), CF DNS quota cleanup, tmpfs orphan recovery, gost relay watchdog, DataDome slider auto-drag. Design goal is unattended operation for weeks.

## Current Status and Entry Barriers

To be frank, this is not an out-of-the-box tool. Running through the entire pipeline requires at least:

- A real, login-capable PayPal account (or go through PayPal guest checkout authorization flow)
- A proxy with exit in EU / US / ID (region locked based on selected payment path)
- A Cloudflare zone (optional, for enabling catch-all subdomain email registration; also supports Outlook code pool)
- A Linux machine capable of running Camoufox + Playwright (approximately 5 GB disk + 2 GB memory)
- (Required for PayPal guest checkout) An SMS code gateway API key for PayPal signup
- (Required for GoPay) A WhatsApp online number + WhatsApp code verification service
- (Optional) An OpenAI-compatible VLM API key for hCaptcha solving; residential / pseudo-residential exits typically don't trigger hCaptcha, and CLIP degradation is available without VLM
- (Optional) A captcha solving platform API key compatible with createTask/getTaskResult protocol as a fallback for browser passive captcha

Full end-to-end setup typically takes 1–3 hours for initial configuration tuning. Once daemon mode runs stably, a single pipeline takes ~5 minutes; concurrent mode with 2 workers on the same phone generates 2 accounts in ~3 minutes.

Code is research-oriented, organized by protocol stage, and doesn't prioritize maximum readability.

---

## Getting Started

### Beginner Path: WebUI Configuration Wizard (Recommended)

Compress 1–3 hours of manual configuration into ~15 minutes. 14-step wizard + real-time preflight self-checks + built-in runtime controller (SSE log stream + concurrency panel) generate `CTF-pay/config.auto.json` + `CTF-reg/config.paypal-proxy.json` configurations.

![WebUI screenshot](docs/images/webui.png)

#### Docker Deployment (Fastest Path, One-Click Start)

The repo comes with `Dockerfile` (multi-stage build: Node frontend + Ubuntu 24.04 runtime) + `docker-compose.yml`, packing all system dependencies / Playwright Chromium+Firefox / Camoufox / gost SOCKS5 relay / Node QuickJS (for OpenAI Sentinel) into the image. The git working tree on the host serves as the single source of truth, bind-mounted into the container; restart with `docker compose restart` for instant effect after modifying Python code, no rebuild needed.```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanOps-1/Gpt-Agreement-Payment
cd Gpt-Agreement-Payment
docker compose up -d --build
# Default listening on 127.0.0.1:8765 (host port), open http://127.0.0.1:8765/ in browser
# First visit redirects to /setup to create admin
```# Common Maintenance Commands:```bash
# Real-time logs
docker compose logs -f webui

# Debug inside container (pip list / run tests / inspect SQLite)
docker compose exec webui bash

# Reload uvicorn after Python code changes (bind mount already syncs source code, just restart process)
docker compose restart webui

# Rebuild dist in container after frontend code changes
docker compose exec webui sh -c "cd /app/webui/frontend && npm run build"

# Completely stop + clean containers
docker compose down

# Image upgrade (pull new base / upgrade Python packages)
docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d
```# Data Persistence

The `output/` directory is a host directory bind mount containing `webui.db` (SQLite) + run results / logs visible and backupable to the host. `webui/frontend/dist` and `node_modules` use anonymous volumes, which are overridden by the baked image version (not overridden by an empty host directory).

## Public Access (nginx Reverse Proxy + HTTPS)

See [`webui/README.md`](webui/README.md). By default, `docker-compose.yml` binds the port to `127.0.0.1:8765`; to expose directly to `0.0.0.0`, modify the `ports` section (not recommended without an authentication layer in front).

#### Manual Installation (without Docker)```bash
# 1. Backend dependencies
pip install -r webui/requirements.txt

# 2. Frontend build (one-time)
cd webui/frontend && pnpm i && pnpm build && cd ../..

# 3. Start
python -m webui.server
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8765 in browser, first visit redirects to /setup to create admin
```Support single run (PayPal billing agreement / GoPay / QRIS / promo long links) + concurrent mode (frontend configured with phone pool + concurrency N), public network access via nginx reverse proxy see [`webui/README.md`](webui/README.md).

### Installation```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanOps-1/Gpt-Agreement-Payment
cd Gpt-Agreement-Payment
pip install requests curl_cffi playwright camoufox browserforge mitmproxy pybase64
playwright install firefox
camoufox fetch
```hCaptcha solver ML dependencies (torch / transformers / opencv) are recommended to be installed separately in a venv, approximately 4 GB:```bash
python -m venv ~/.venvs/ctfml
~/.venvs/ctfml/bin/pip install torch transformers opencv-python pillow numpy
```# Complete dependency list and system packages, see [`docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md).

### Configuration

Copy the template and fill in values:```bash
cp CTF-pay/config.paypal.example.json     CTF-pay/config.paypal.json
cp CTF-reg/config.paypal-proxy.example.json   CTF-reg/config.paypal-proxy.json
```For field meanings and schema, see [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md). The Docker deployment entrypoint will automatically bootstrap these two config files on first startup. After editing on the host, run `docker compose restart webui` to take effect.

### Running

> Docker users only need to use webui to run. The CLI commands below are for users running natively locally; to run the same commands in Docker, first `docker compose exec webui bash` to enter the container.```bash
# 1) Single complete workflow (PayPal billing agreement)
xvfb-run -a python pipeline.py --config CTF-pay/config.paypal.json --paypal

# 2) Plus protocol authorization + promo long link (PayPal guest checkout)
xvfb-run -a python scripts/no_card_paypal_plus.py \
    --config CTF-pay/config.paypal.json --paypal-node-rpa \
    --phone <your_phone> --otp-timeout 240

# 3) N worker concurrency (same phone is fine, OTP phase auto-queues via advisory lock)
# Recommended to start via webui: select concurrency mode, frontend configures phone pool + concurrency N

# 4) Continuous account pool maintenance
xvfb-run -a python pipeline.py --config CTF-pay/config.paypal.json --paypal --daemon
```# Four Operating Modes (Single / Batch / Self-Dealer / Daemon) + Concurrency Mode Differences and Parameters

See [`docs/operating-modes.md`](docs/operating-modes.md).

## Known Limitations

- **PayPal billing agreement only available in EU**. Stripe account restrictions; can only place orders as EU identities like IE.
- **PayPal guest checkout path subject to multiple risk controls**. `INSTRUMENT_SHARING_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` / `CC_LINKED_TO_FULL_ACCOUNT` / `CREATE_CARD_ACCOUNT_CANDIDATE_VALIDATION_ERROR` / DataDome captcha etc. will all trigger; the script has early exit + automatic retry branches for each known error.
- **Batch registration next-day survival rate ~2%**. This is caused by batch correlation effects in ChatGPT's anti-fraud mechanism, not the tool itself. See [`docs/anti-fraud-research.md`](docs/anti-fraud-research.md).
- **Free account path currently not working**. OpenAI changed the free account secondary login flow; redirect to `/add-phone` cannot be bypassed without a real phone number; ChatGPT-Web client's access_token calling Codex API has audience mismatch.
- **Stripe runtime fingerprint drifts**. `runtime.version` / `js_checksum` / `rv_timestamp` need realignment approximately every few weeks.
- **hCaptcha question type coverage incomplete**. Current 12 common types; when uncovered, VLM directly outputs coordinates as fallback, success rate not guaranteed.
- **Concurrency shares single exit IP**. Webshare pool currently can only provide a single IP; N workers traverse the same IP; recommended concurrency ≤ 3 to avoid PayPal/DataDome risk control joint punishment. Multi-IP pool support on roadmap.
- **Code style somewhat rough**. `_monolith.py` arranged sequentially by protocol stage, comments mix Chinese and English, not suitable as a Python engineering example.
